# PurgeNote

<p>Every requirement internal: clients still see which roles grant it.</p>

Protocol: <code>crucibleJson</code>.

## Authentication

- Bearer token (<code>crucible.api#httpBearerAuth</code>): send <code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code>.

## Authorization

Requires permissions internal to the service.

<p>Granted by <code>owner</code> at <code>workspace</code>.</p>

## Request syntax

```http
POST /workspaces/{workspaceId}/notes/{noteId}/purge HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer {token}
Crucible-Version: 1
```

<code>Crucible-Version</code> names the release this page describes. A request without it is served at the release the service chooses for unversioned requests, which may be an older one.

An error response names its code in the <code>X-Crucible-Error</code> header and in its JSON body.

## Idempotency and retries

Readonly: false. Idempotent: false.

## Generated sample

Generated from the model's types and constraints, not written by the API's authors. Nothing beyond those constraints was checked, so the service may still refuse a value (a query its parser rejects, an id that does not exist).

Request:

```http
POST /workspaces/workspaceId/notes/noteId/purge HTTP/1.1
```

Response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200
```
